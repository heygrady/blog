This is my updated blog. The old content will be [kept around](https://2012.heygrady.com) for posterity but it hasn't really been updated in the last 5 years. The old blog was built with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which proved cumbersome to keep up-to-date. This new blog is built with [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), which should make things much easier.

**NOTE:** This was written for [Gatsby 0.12.48](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/73dcc32d0041de6057d6328f0563b4e6cfb5e160). Version 1.0 [has been released](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/gatsby-v1/). A later post demonstrates [how I upgraded](/upgrading-gatsby/).

## I want a new blog
A lot has changed since 2012. Publishing static content on the web has gotten *much* easier. This blog will be an experimental place for me to make posts. Mostly I'm just trying to reduce my barrier to making posts to near-zero and giving myself a more stable place to make notes. Choosing Gatsby is a way to get up and running quickly, bonus points for being built on top of the React stack.

## More practical posts
I'm going to try and document my adventures of trying to *get things done* using modern tooling. This is mostly about capturing my own notes. Who knows... at this very moment I'm just dumping text into a markdown file to get a feel for it.

## What did I do?
- Made a new `gatsby` branch
- Cleaned out all of the old files
- Installed the Gatsby [starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)
- Did some basic configuration

### Make a new branch
I had an [old blog](https://github.com/heygrady/blog/tree/9d1717812a2562bbb3136faaf0238365f091ace8) already in my GitHub. I cloned `heygrady/blog` `master` and branched it as `gatsby`. Then I wiped the directory clean and installed Gatsby.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:heygrady/blog.git
git checkout -b gatsby
# manually move all of the files to an _old folder, keeping only .git in place
```

### Install Gatsby
The installation process for Gatsby is covered better elsewhere, you should [follow the instructions](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/v0.12.48/README.md). For posterity, this is what I did:

```bash
npm install -g gatsby
gatsby new blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

### Basic configuration
- Reviewed `config.toml` (set the link prefix to an empty string)
- Added a personal profile pic
- Added a custom config value for my Twitter handle and updated `components/Bio.js`

### New pages
It's tedious to make new pages. Let's add a dead-simple starter script that makes a generic post with all of the timestamps in place.

Gatsby initializes projects with a few [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) in the [`package.json`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/blob/6398adac1bc290addc00baf4ff9a3af3256c55db/package.json#L35-L40) file. This makes it easy to collect scripts that are important to your project. It's [pretty handy](https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/).

Here's my starter script for making new posts. It creates a timestamped folder in the `pages/` directory and adds an `index.md` with a timestamp as well as some default [frontmatter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby#frontmatter-and-metadata).

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "page": "DATE=\"$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')\" FOLDER=\"pages/$DATE-title\" FILE=\"$FOLDER/index.md\" && mkdir $FOLDER && touch $FILE && echo \"---\ntitle: \\\"Title\\\"\ndescription: \\\"Fix me.\\\"\ndate: \\\"$(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\\\"\nreadNext: \\\"/fix-me/\\\"\npath: \\\"/title/\\\"\n---\" >> $FILE"
  }
}
```

## What's next?
This blog has a few main goals that I will try to cover in upcoming posts.

- [Launching this blog on Firebase](/first-launch/)
- [Moving the old blog and setting up redirects](/migrating-old-site/)
- [Setting up continuous deployment for the new blog](/deploying-travis/)
