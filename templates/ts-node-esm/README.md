# Package Template: ts-node-esm

New package template for TypeScript with Node ESM.

```sh
yarn add @heygrady/ts-node-esm
```

## Usage

This package supports both CJS and ESM formats. You will see `cjs`, `esm` and `types` builds in the `dist` folder to support Common JS, ECMAScript Modules and TypeScript respectively. In practice you should be able to import it however you prefer and it will just work.

### TypeScript and ESM (preferred)

Node ESM and TypeScript support the same modern syntax for imports.

```ts
import { example } from '@heygrady/ts-node-esm'

console.log(example)
```

### CJS

Legacy Node supports Common JS require syntax for imports.

```js
const { example } = require('@heygrady/ts-node-esm')

console.log(example)
```
